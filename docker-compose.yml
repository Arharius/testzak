      # In production, Next.js executes on the server side, so it needs to know how to reach backend internally
      # We might need a reverse proxy (Nginx) later, but for simple deployment:
      NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: http://localhost:8000
      # Note: Client-side fetches need public URL. Server-side fetches need internal URL.
      # For this simple prototype, client-side fetching to localhost is assumed for local use,
      # BUT for a real server, this must be the domain name or IP.
